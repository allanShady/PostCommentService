# Description

The main propose of this article is show how to take advantaje in docker in order to use a basic .Net Core 2.2 enviroment. Creating a ASP.Net Core Web API with access to SQL Server. All the technologies used in this article are full open-source.

## The Application

It is application focoused on blog posts and comments publications. All the concerns here are regarding a backend development.

# Docker Images

The first concern on dockerizing a application is to create a docker image for your application. WeÂ´ll build two containers, one for our application and other for the database. The database image will be pulled from the cloud, and our only concern it is to pay attention with the configuration.

## Application Docker Image

https://github.com/rodrigostrj/PostCommentService/blob/master/src/PostComment/Dockerfile

```yaml
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2 AS build-env
WORKDIR /app

COPY . ./
RUN dotnet publish PostComment.Api -c Release -o out

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:2.2
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build-env /app/PostComment.Api/out .

ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "PostComment.Api.dll"]
```


$ docker build -t postcomment.api .
$ docker build -f [File Path Here] -t postcomment.api .

## .Net Core
$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name myapp postcomment.api

## SQL Server
docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=yourStrong(!)Password' -e 'MSSQL_DB=postcomment_db' -e 'MSSQL_USER=yourDbUser' -e 'MSSQL_PASSWORD=yourDbPassword' -p 1433:1433 -d mcmoe/mssqldocker:v2017.CU12.1


# Docker Compose

A Docker Compose it is a yaml file with instructions to create containers. It is possible to create a full application. it is easier, at least in my opinion, work in this way instead using docker run for each expected application. 
By executing one command line it is possible to perform all the previus commands even the build command for application.

https://github.com/rodrigostrj/PostCommentService/blob/master/src/PostComment/docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: '3'

volumes:
   dbdata:

services:
    db:
        image: mcmoe/mssqldocker:v2017.CU12.1
        environment:
          ACCEPT_EULA: Y
          SA_PASSWORD: 1p@sswordY
          MSSQL_DB: postcommentdb
          MSSQL_USER: postcommentdb_app
          MSSQL_PASSWORD: 1p@sswordY
        ports:
            - "1433:1433"

    postcomment.api:
        depends_on:
           - db
        image: postcomment.api
        build:
          context: .
        ports:
          - "8080:80"
        environment:
          - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=staging
```

$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose -f [File Path Here] up -d
$ docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
